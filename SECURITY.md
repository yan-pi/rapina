## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you discover a security vulnerability in Rapina, please report it privately. Do not open a public GitHub issue.

**How to report:** Use GitHub's private vulnerability reporting at [Report a vulnerability](https://github.com/arferreira/rapina/security/advisories/new).

We will acknowledge your report within 48 hours, triage within 7 days, and work toward a fix. Security patches are published via GitHub Releases and the [RustSec advisory database](https://rustsec.org).

Reporters are credited in the advisory and release notes unless they prefer to remain anonymous.
